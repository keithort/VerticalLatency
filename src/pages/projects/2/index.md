In an effort to further shore up my skillset with React, I decided to start a series of small projects driven by APIs. This project uses pulls data from a public news API by [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/). There is a 15 minute delay on headlines due to it being on their free plan. I'm using keyword searches to narrow the scope of their global article search to pull out stories that might pique my interest, namely those related to science, sports, and technology.

Version 1 is up and live. Version 2 will include some fancy animations.

You can view the application on [Surge](https://poised-toothpaste.surge.sh/) and the source code at [GitHub](https://github.com/keithort/news-aggregator).

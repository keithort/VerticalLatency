Open source development can seem intimidating to new developers. Complex vocabulary. Fear of rejection. Intimidating code bases. These are all relatable feelings to have. 

So where does a new developer start? Documentation. As a new developer to a project, you are the one who benefits most from quality documentation. Read through it closely. Not only will this give you a better idea of how the project works and why it exists, you can spot minor grammatical and spelling errors. Look for a CONTRIBUTING.md

Get in there and fork (create a copy of a project under your account you can freely modify), commit your edits (save to your copy of the code base), and make a pull request (ask the original coders to merge in your edits).

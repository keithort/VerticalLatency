I started porting this site over to Gatsby.js about 6 months ago. I didn't lose interest, I lost the time. I started a new position with a company called Digitec Interactive. Digitec is an interesting LMS (Learning Management System) akin to something you'd see at Treehouse or Lynda.com. As part of my role, I had to focus on Angular.js rather than React. With Gatsby being a React based static site generator, this had to go on the back burner. 

The migration has always been a pet project. I don't recall when or where I first heard of Gatsby. I do know it was from a newsletter I subscribe to. It has steadily grown in popularity over the past 8 or 9 months since I was made aware of it. It really is a great tool.

For now, if you have any questions or feedback, let me know.

Thanks

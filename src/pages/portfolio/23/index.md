I was subcontracted by another developer to build a new site for Bauer Financial in late 2017. We agreed that a modified premium template was the best bet for Bauer. The client was happy with the base template called Monument Valley. I then created a child theme based off of it and we built a beautiful new site that exceeded the client's expectations. The result was a site that was mobile friendly, informative, and included a powerful shopping cart customized to fit their needs.

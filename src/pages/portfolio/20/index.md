The very definition of rapid development, I was tasked with building out the design for the home page and 1 sub page in a couple days in advance of a presentation. Upon the acceptance of the idea, I was given content and asked to build out the remainder of the site. From initial concept to prouduction launch, this site was live in 5 business days. This project's success was based on the foundational work I had done with the boilerplate for rapid theme development.

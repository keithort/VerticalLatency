Timeshare Calendar was long in the tooth. We needed to update it to be mobile friendly and up to date. I pushed back on the original design pointing out a few issues with the layout of the homepage's contact form when used on scaled down for mobile devices. A new plugin was created that pulled in accurate timeshare schedules and updated accordingly. The new site was a stark improvement in performance and usability.

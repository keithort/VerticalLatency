As the iPad revolution took hold, Field & Stream recognized that a big portion of their web site was unusable for those users. They tasked our team with converting it while maintaining the same look and feel. Working with the developer, we replaced the flash player with a JavaScript based solution that still tied in to the Drupal CMS. The new carousel ended up working quite well and was a near seemless change for users.

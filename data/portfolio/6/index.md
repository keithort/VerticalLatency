In early 2012, the Islands team wanted to see if they could expand their footprint with resorts by hosting a finder tool to send the resorts quality customers. We built out a tool that had the user answer 4 questions and lead them to their ideal resort or vacation destination. The minisite incorporated the framework from the existing property and included an area for administrators to add details for a property or location.

Fresh off my contract with NBCUniversal, I was presented an opportunity to work with another great brand in Haagen-Dazs Ice Cream. No, I did not receive any free samples of new flavors. Instead I was asked to build out the site from the mockups. In order to better work on the project on a detailed scale, I went old school. I printed out the designs and the interaction notes. 21 blueprint sized rolls of paper later, I was able to meticulously build out the site to be responsive and bring the brand's web site into the modern age.

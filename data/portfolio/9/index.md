2009 brought about it a refreshed advertising campaign for vodka makers, Ketel One. Through a marketing agency, I was brought on to build out the Facebook page for their new messaging. The page features embedded videos and music downloading for an exclusive song. It is a simple yet tasteful use of serif fonts to match the logo and showcase the black and bronze color scheme.

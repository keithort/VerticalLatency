Bonnier was constantly searching for new partnership opportunities. One such possibility was a custom content hub that incorporated paid-for marketing onto an existing brands web site. We built a template that allowed the sales team to reach out to potential customers and offer a way for them to increase the visibility with potential customers. The content, images, and logo were all adjustable by the administrator.

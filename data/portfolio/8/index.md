The project owners for Outdoor Life wanted to freshen up the look of the blog for the deer hunters, Big Buck Zone. It was to feature the latest article, incorporate a photo contest and harvest graph while incorporating more hunting related content from the site. We built out a beautiful subsite that accomplished these goals and worked uniformly in all browsers.

preDOCS was created to simplify the process of closing on a home. We would partner with various title agencies and convert their long form paper documents into elegant web forms. Users are emailed a unique link, sign in or register, and fill out their forms. Upon completion, they can electronically sign them. I handcrafted the HTML and JavaScript to smooth things out by prefilling data when users returned. In the end, we were able to create custom multi-page forms tailored for each agency and improve their customer satisfaction.

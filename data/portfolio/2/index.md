Field & Stream and Outdoor Life magazines sponsor an annual convention highlighting the latest products and techniques to improve the results for hunters. Our team was approached to build the site out to replace an existing, poorly designed and highly cluttered web site with a more modern one. When we received the PSDs, the build out began. The developer set things up in Drupal matching up with the clients requests. Midway through development, we were asked to make it responsive as well. This required a good amount of refactoring to achieve a quality experience on different devices as well as maintaining the desktop usability. The end result was a quality site that is light on resources and responds to the users environment.

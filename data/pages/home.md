![Headshot](./headshot.jpg#alignRight) I am Keith and have been developing performant, modern web sites in the Central Florida area since 2005. I primarily work with TypeScript, React, HTML, and CSS. I have built custom themes for WordPress and Woocommerce.

I am a significant contributor with a deep knowledge base in design, testing, version control, documentation, build, deployment, and operations. I recognize and utilize user interface design patterns to solve business problems with excellent knowledge and execution of UI design principles. Systematic, disciplined, and creative approach to project challenges.
